json-text-extractor (JTEx) is a translator tool for extracting "source text" from a JSON file into a TXT file.

# HOW TO USE?
1- Download the JTEx onto your computer.\n
2- Extract "JTEx.exe" and "settings.py" into a folder.\n
3- Put your JSON file that holds your "source text" into the same folder of JTEx's.\n
4- Open "settings.py". (You can use Notepad.)\n
5- Edit the "settings.py" according to your needs.\n

# WHEN TO USE?
JTEx is not tested for all kinds of JSON files. I have written JTEx to use on our localization project: "The Sorrowvirus: A Faceless Short Story".\n
To improve JTEx, I need more JSON files that holds text values of a game.\n
\n
I hope that you can utilize JTEx.\n
\n
Have a nice day.
